# facial-expression-detection-using-Machine-Learning

The System detects the facial emotion among the seven different types of emotions using the convolutional neural network (CNN) Architecture at the accuracy rate of 60 % and a loss of less than 0.20.

The seven types of expressions are :

Angry
sad
fear

surprise
disgust
Happy

The model is trained and tested over fer_2013 image dataset available on kaggle, with the total epoche count of 50.

The model is connected with the web0cam using OpenCV.
